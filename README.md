# PumpController
 Control pool pump remotely
Using Java JPA, Html, Css, Javascript.
--The embedded javascript is not ideal, this was my first time using it, for future use I would create separate "classes" for the javascript functions. --I use an arduino ESP 32 micro controller to operate a relay which is attached to the pump control system. The arduino has a built in wifi chip which allows me to grab data from my api, this lets the arduino know if it should be on or off based on the set schedule or override function.
